# Roll out OPNsense on Proxmox Hosts 

This is an Ansible playbook to roll out OPNsense on Proxmox. It is a simplified version of the _KPMA1985_'s script to be found here: https://github.com/kpma1985/ansible_proxmox_hetzner/tree/master.

The playbook rolls out OPNsense with a minimum of two interfaces (WAN + x number of LAN-interfaces). You can simply adjust the interface configurations as described below. It will establish a rule to expose the WebGUI over the WAN interface, if that variable is set to true. It will enable Outbound NAT, if you want this to be enabled. You can define the root password to your liking.

### NOTE
The script will destroy a running VM based on the defined VM ID, if the variable _force_clean_ exists and is set to _true_.

## Usage

### 1. Install Ansible
This highly depends on your environment, so please google that for yourself.

### 2. Adjust the inventory
Fill in the required information. Note: This script works with SSH-keys, not with passwords. 

### 3. Adjust the variables in group_vars/all.yml
See below for a list of variables.

### 4. Run the playbook from the console:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml install_opnsense.yml
```
